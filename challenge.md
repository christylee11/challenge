# Front End Dev Challenge

## Introduction
This is meant to be a quick assessment of your front-end web development skills. Ideally we want an applicant to be able to build an appealing front-end to an API. We estimate this should take 1-2 hours of your time, although you may take as long as you would like. This is intended to be open ended and require you to make a lot of design decisions.

## Instructions
The challenge is to choose an API from this list: https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis/blob/master/README.md

And build a website (just the html/js) that has the following features

1. Allow a user to retrieve information present in the API and display it on the site
2. Provide an appealing UI for the site
3. Run on most modern browsers
4. Have good code organization/tidiness. We understand there are a lot of different conventions for organizing a front-end codebase and we are mainly just looking for any organization system.

## Setup
Fork this repo and include all code and instructions to locally host the site. Upon completion push a tag to the forked repo indicating it is complete "finished".
